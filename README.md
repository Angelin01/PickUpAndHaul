# PickUpAndHaul
"Greatest hauling mod ever" - Chicken Plucker

Colonists will gather stuff in their inventory, then haul it all to a stockpile.

This hauling mod will greatly increase hauling efficiency, because pawns can now carry more than one gun or t-shirt. Those smart and intelligent colonists can use their inventory! You gotta see it to believe it.

## Functionality
If possible, colonists that can haul will haul stuff to their inventory, pick up one more item to haul to a stockpile and then unload their inventory. If for some reason pawns run out of things to haul before their inventory is full, they will unload themselves:
- At semi-regular intervals, if their inventory contains 3 items or more.
- When their inventory has reached a certain mass limit.
- When they haul something else to a stockpile.
- When they're idle.

You can tell colonists to pick up an item and keep it in their inventory. They will remember what they have and keep it on their person. This is very practical for field doctoring, or for animal trainers taming herds of animals.

## Limitations
- Only player-owned humanlikes can use their inventory to haul. Rule of thumb: If you can order it to equip a gun or wear a pair of pants, it'll use their inventory to haul for you. No guests, animals pretending to be robots, dogs, prisoners, or whatever else.
- At (rare) intervals, under certain specific conditions, pawns will unload everything they have in their inventory. This is a type of garbage collection on my part. I'm not happy with it just yet.
- The unloading isn't perfect or bulletproof. Colonists will occasionally turn into kleptomaniacs. There's a fine line between "Pick Up And Haul", "Pick Up And Walk Back Immediately" and "Pick Up And Hoard All The Things".

## Compatibility notes:
Should work fine with other hauling mods like AllowTool's Haul Urgently, Please Haul Perishables and Stack Merger, but they don't gain the inventory-benefit.

Works well together with Simple Sidearms.

Does not conflict with Combat Extended, but if Pick Up And Haul detects CE, then it will lay dormant.

Compatibility and synergy is the next goal. Let me know in the comments which mod to prioritise.

## Future plans:
- Synergy with Haul Urgently, Please Haul Perishables and Combat Extended. Not conflicting is one thing, cooperating is another.
- Mod settings.
- Many more refinements.

## Balance notes:  
On the one hand this takes away a frustration of mine, but I can't deny that it won't make the game at least somewhat easier. You can bring back some of that challenge again with my other mods like [Sun Tzu Raider Tactics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1147799676) or [Climate Cycle ++](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1266884568).
