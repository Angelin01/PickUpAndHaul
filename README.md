## PickUpAndHaul
"Greatest hauling mod ever" - Chicken Plucker

Colonists will gather stuff in their inventory, then haul it all to a stockpile.

This hauling mod will greatly increase hauling efficiency, because pawns can now carry more than one gun or t-shirt. Those smart and intelligent colonists can use their inventory! You gotta see it to believe it.

#Compatibility notes:
Should work fine with other hauling mods like AllowTool's Haul Urgently, Please Haul Perishables and Stack Merger, but they don't gain the inventory-benefit. May or may not work with Combat Extended. Compatibility and synergy is the next goal. Let me know in the comments which mod to prioritise.

Save-game compatible. If you want to remove it, draft everybody before removing it.

#Balance notes:  
On the one hand this takes away a frustration of mine, but I can't deny that it won't make the game at least somewhat easier. You can bring back some of that challenge again with my other mods like [Sun Tzu Raider Tactics](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1147799676) or [Climate Cycle ++](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1266884568).
